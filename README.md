# Who made this?
My name is Marcus Haddon. I lived and worked in the service/retail industry in Austin, TX for ~10 years. I want to do whatever I can to help people who have been put out of work by Covid-19 stay afloat. After seeing the "Virtual Tip Jars" being put together in various cities, I thought offering automatically recurring payments or scheduled prompts to send tips to a user's local Virtual Tip Jar could be a good way to ensure that tips keep flowing in for the duration of this crisis.

## Privacy
This service collects your phone number, the schedule on which you would like to be reminded, the tip jar you are sending tips to (which is associated with a specific city or establishment), and optionally your name and what your virtual tip is for. It does not collect any payment information.

The above information will be used to send you text messages with venmo/paypal/cashapp links to tip randomly chosen members of the tip jar of your choice. It will not be shared with any third party for any reason. Should you wish to opt out, your information will be deleted from this database immediately, and internal logging/diagnostic data containing your personal information will be purged within 30 days.

Please contact virtual.tip.reminder@gmail.com with any questions or concerns.
